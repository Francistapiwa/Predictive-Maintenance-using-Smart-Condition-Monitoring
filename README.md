# Predictive-Maintenance-using-Smart-Condition-Monitoring
Introduction
As more intelligent and automated systems are being developed across several industries such as mining, construction, manufacturing, and the automotive sector, the demand for systems that address maintenance challenges associated with both automated and manual machinery is evident. Organizations rely on various assets that are crucial to their operations, and these assets must be maintained in optimal working condition while ensuring maximum utilization without compromising safety or uptime.
Implementing a Smart Condition Monitoring (SCM) system can help companies remain competitive on a global scale by improving operational efficiency through increased uptime, extended equipment lifespan, and enhanced machine performance. By leveraging real-time sensor data, organizations can gain better insights into their assets, enabling proactive maintenance strategies and reducing unplanned downtime.

For this capstone project, I aim to develop an IoT-based Smart Condition Monitoring system. The system will utilize an ESP-32, a motor attached to a fan, and a nine-axis sensor consisting of a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, and a three-axis magnetometer to comprehensively measure the machine’s vibration and motion. Additionally, the ESP-32 camera module will serve as an image sensor, providing visual insights into the motor’s condition. The nine-axis sensor will be mounted on the motor housing to capture precise vibration and motion data.

The collected sensor data will be used to develop a predictive machine learning model for classifying different operational states of the motor. This involves gathering data under various conditions, such as different speeds, obstructions, or complete stops, and interpreting these patterns for future improvements.

To enhance usability, I will develop an interactive system featuring widgets that display essential sensor data, allowing end-users to visualize machine performance in real time. The system will also generate alerts based on the severity of detected issues, enabling timely maintenance interventions. Additionally, the camera module will facilitate remote monitoring, allowing users to visually inspect the motor if an obstruction or malfunction is detected.

This solution is unique because it integrates multiple sensing modalities vibration analysis, motion tracking, and visual inspection into a single IoT-based platform. Unlike traditional condition monitoring systems that rely solely on vibration data, this approach enhances diagnostic accuracy by incorporating real-time imaging and multi-sensor fusion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of machine health. Furthermore, by leveraging edge computing on the ESP-32, the system reduces latency and bandwidth requirements, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for industrial applications.
